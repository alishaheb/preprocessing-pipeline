# preprocessing-pipeline
This repository provides a comprehensive overview of data preprocessing pipelines in machine learning. It explains the concept of pipelines and demonstrates their practical implementation using scikit-learn. The project covers essential preprocessing techniques such as handling missing data, feature scaling, one-hot encoding, imputation, and dropping unnecessary columns. Additionally, it highlights the benefits of using pipelines—improved code organization, readability, and reusability—and demonstrates how to integrate them with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to build more efficient and reproducible ML workflows.
